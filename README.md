# ChimeraStack Presentation

ChimeraStack Presentation is a React-based slide deck designed to showcase the ChimeraStack project—a solution for automating development environments. This presentation was developed as part of the final project for the RNCP38606 Full Stack Developer certification at IT-Akademy. It demonstrates our technical skills from both frontend and backend perspectives, along with deployment and DevOps practices.

## Overview

ChimeraStack started as a CLI tool to simplify development environment configurations and evolved into a full web platform. This presentation highlights:
- The evolution from CLI to web platform.
- The architecture and design of the frontend (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and backend (API RESTful with PHP, JWT, and payment integration).
- The deployment process using Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), and Nginx with SSL.

Several slides include enhanced versions (located in sub-folders named `Enhanced`) with refined graphics and content.

## Features

- **Modular Slide Deck:** Each section (Title, Summary, Introduction, Frontend, Backend, Deployment, Conclusion) is implemented as an independent React component.
- **Internal Carousels:** Sections like Frontend, Backend, and Deployment include carousels to present multiple sub-slides with smooth transitions (using Framer Motion).
- **Responsive & Themed Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS supporting dark/light modes and centered content for a professional look.
- **Dockerized Development:** Ensures consistency across environments using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Static Build for GitHub Pages:** The final build is static and can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
